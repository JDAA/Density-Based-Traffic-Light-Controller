# Density-Based-Traffic-Light-Controller
A  Smart Traffic Light Controller that ensures that signal of a particular direction should only function if there is traffic in that direction.

Components Required Density Based Traffic Light Controller Using Arduino
The components you are going to require for this project are as follows

Arduino Mega 2560
4 X HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors
4 X Red LEDs
4 X Green LEDs
4 X Yellow LEDs
12 X 220 ohm resistors
Jumper cables
Breadboards

The main purpose of this project is, if there will be no traffic on the other signal, one shouldnâ€™t wait for that signal. The system will skip that signal and will move on the next one.

Arduino UNO is the main part of this project and it will be used to read from ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 and calculate the distance. This distance will tell us if any vehicle is near the signal or not and according to that the traffic signals will be controlled.
